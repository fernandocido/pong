# pong
Trying to replicate a Pong Game with JavaScript to be played at:

[p5js](https://editor.p5js.org/)

Load all files (you need to <strong>log in</strong>);
Hit <strong>Play</strong>;
Click the game screen;
Use <strong>"W"</strong> and <strong>"S"</strong> keys to move the left racket (racket1);
Use <strong>"UP"</strong> and <strong>"DOWN"</strong> keys to move the right racket (racket2);
If you wish to play alone, check lines <strong>114</strong> and <strong>178</strong)>.

Enjoy :)
